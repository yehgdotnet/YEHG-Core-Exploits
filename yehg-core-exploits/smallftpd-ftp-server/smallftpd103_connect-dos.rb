				This module triggers unauthenticated Denial-of-Service condition in SmallFTPD server versions 1.0.3-fix and earlier with a few dozens of connection requests. The vulnerability is probably concerned with smallftpd being unable to handle multiple connections regardless of its maximum connection settings. Upon successful DoS exploit, the smallftpd will crash or still seem functioning by showing its service banner. But in fact it stops rejecting new FTP login requests.
